# AdapTable Support Template for Vanilla JavaScript

This is a very basic example of how to get started with AdapTable - the market-leading, low code AG Grid extension.

This template is particularly useful if you wish to build a very small demo for Support purposes.

It is written purely in **JavaScript** and does not use one of the Framework wrappers, nor does it use TypeScript.

For full information on how to use AdapTable see the [AdapTable Documentation](https://docs.adaptabletools.com).

## Versions and Dependencies

The demo is built using these key packages:

- [AdapTable](https://docs.adaptabletools.com/) version 17.x
- [AG Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com) version 30.x

## Contents

This template contains just the bare bones required to set up an AdapTable instance. 

A "real world" example would likely include:

- Design-time - providing [Adaptable Options](https://docs.adaptabletools.com/guide/reference-options-overview) and [Predefined Config](https://docs.adaptabletools.com/guide/reference-predefined-config) to configure the application
- Run-time - using the [Adaptable API](https://docs.adaptabletools.com/guide/reference-api-overview) and listening to [Adaptable Events](https://docs.adaptabletools.com/guide/reference-event-overview)

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `yarn`), depending on what tool you're using.

## Running in Development Mode

Execute the following command

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

Now navigate to [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) in order the see AdapTable in action.

Any change you make in your sources will trigger a browser reload, since parceljs comes with built-in hot-reloading in order to keep you productive.

## Building for Production

```sh
$ npm run build
```

This generates a `dist` folder, which you can deploy on a webserver.

On your local machine, you can run

```sh
$ npx serve dist
```

to launch a webserver that serves the generated `dist` folder - now go to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to see the production version.
